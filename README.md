# What is this?

This repo started off as a rendering algorithm learning repository and stopped as soon as I hit the limitations to my initially planned project - a console based, character shaded game engine that uses raycasting to appear 3D. 

I have moved on to create a 3D engine in OpenGL using the GLM,GLSL,GLFW and GLAD and recreating the world initially made in the simple barebones unicode engine.

This repository is purely to teach myself rendering techniques and general graphics programming while also being a pet project - a basic 3d engine
