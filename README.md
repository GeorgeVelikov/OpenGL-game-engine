# Raycasting-experiment

This is a pet project in which I started off inspired by John Carmack's & id software's incredible work.

The innitial idea was to create a basic UNICODE character game engine (instead of pixels) using a rendering technique called raycasting. But as I progressed there were obvious limitations to the console and the strings a console can display. A limit of around 160x160 in a single buffer existed and the solutions were either to "glue" together multiple buffers to a console or change up the project idea. I went with the latter as I had already learned what I aimed to learn from the initial unicode project.

I proceeded by starting off an opengl project and will try to re-create the unicode game engine and hopefully expand on it once I have recreated it.
